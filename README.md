## Uncertainty-quantification-in-neural-state-space-models-applications 
This repository contains the implementation of the Paper "Uncertainty quantification in neural state-space models: applications
for experiment design and uncertainty-aware MPC"
### Authors
Milad Banitalebi Dehkordi, Marco Forgione, and Dario Piga
### Requirements
The python requires the following packages:
- numpy
- random
- pytorch    (main package)
- scipy      (main package)
- matplotlib (required for ploting)
- pickle     (required for loading data reading/writing)
### Instructions
1)  SI_ExperimentDesign.ipynb: execute to obtain the results for the experiment design case study.
2)  SI_ExperimentDesign_MonteCarloRun.ipynb: execute to obtain the Monte-Carlo results for the experiment design case study.
3)  MonteCarloPlotter.ipynb: execute to obtain the figures for the Monte-Carlo case study.
4)  SI_rNMPC_CSTR_MISO_MultipleRef_CaseStudy Argument.ipynb: execute to obtain the results for the uncertainty-aware MPC case study.
